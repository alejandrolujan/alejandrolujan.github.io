          <h1>I lead</h1>
          <p>I have managed teams of incredibly talented software engineers at Instacart and Shopify. As a team leader, I believe in empowering others and getting out of the way so the team can be successful. I'm also good at balancing business needs with team capabilities and I am not afraid to speak out when pressures or constraints hurt the team roadmap.</p>

          <h1>I teach</h1>
          <p>For 4 years, I was a professional trainer and taught over a thousand people how to use the Scala platform. The greatest thing about teaching is seeing someone's face light up when they internalize something they've learned. Guiding someone through that process is incredibly rewarding.</p>

          <h1>I build</h1>
          <p>My dad told me once I could build software to do work for us. I was 8. I still marvel at the value we can create with technology. I enjoy building systems and products people love to use. I also believe in the potential of technology to support positive change for individuals and communities.</p>

        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p>Do you find yourself navigating life's ups and downs, craving more fulfillment and clarity? Do you feel you manifest your best self on some days, while on others, you fall short of your full capacity?</p>
        <p>I help people make steady progress by encouraging practical reflection and setting concrete goals in alignment with their values.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection-left">
        <h2>What You Will Get</h2>
        <p>As a coach, I can help you better understand where you're currently at, where you want to go, and what is holding you back. Some examples of areas I can help you navigate:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You don’t feel fulfilled in your current job</li>
          <li>You feel stuck professionally and don’t know what your next step is</li>
          <li>You feel held back and unable to manifest your full potential</li>
          <li>You’re not happy with your work-life balance</li>
          <li>You have all the wisdom you need to make change happen and find more of what you want - joy, abundance, freedom.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let’s work together to awaken your wisdom, so you can carve your own path.</p>

      <h1>Coaching Testimonials</h1>

      <div class="testimonial">
        <p>Alejandro is a remarkable mentor and coach. Throughout our time working together, both while he was my manager and beyond, his support has been invaluable. What truly sets him apart is his genuine care for others' success and his unique ability to turn a challenging day into a great one through active listening, providing guidance, and helping with reflection to find clarity on what truly matters in the long run. I wholeheartedly recommend his coaching services to anyone seeking professional development.</p>
        <p class="author">Maryam, former report and coachee</p>

      <div class="testimonial">
        <p>Working with Alejandro was an incredibly insightful experience. In just three sessions, he helped me feel truly heard and validated in what I was going through. His thoughtful questions challenged me to reflect deeply on what I want to do and how I want to show up for myself. I walked away with greater clarity and confidence, and I’m grateful for his guidance. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for meaningful growth and self-discovery!</p>

      <div class="testimonial">
        <p>I've known Alejandro as my colleague, manager and mentor, during his time at Shopify. He uses a very structured approach towards time management, team management and solving complex problems. His demeanor has always been very humble and solution oriented. In all my conversations with him, personal or professional, he has used his deep experience and ability to actively listen and empathize in order to help point towards the right direction, sometimes even an invaluable shift in perspective. I'd recommend Alejandro to anyone seeking a coach who would empower them to take on their ambitions.</p>

      <div class="testimonial">
        <p>Working with Alejendro was the support I needed especially in the midst of my layoff and job search. My coaching sessions with him resulted in a newfound confidence which I can say definitely helped me in my subsequent interviews; some that eventually became job offers. I truly appreciated his supportive and thoughtful approach. It was just the right amount of guidance that ultimately helped me help myself more. For anyone looking for a coach that can empower and inspire, look no further!</p>
